# K-Rhiza

*K-Rhiza* is a resilient messaging system built on top of a Kademlia DHT.
This is my course project for UBC's CPSC 538B Distributed Systems Abstractions course.

This is only a proof-of-concept.

To run K-Rhiza, you need to have the Go programming language
and Protocol buffer compiler (`protoc`) installed.
Run:
```
make install
```
to install the K-Rhiza server and client.
